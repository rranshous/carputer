use sinknode to move data
going to add some public key encryption so i can end-to-end encrypt the data from the carputer

on carputer will have
 usb camera
 gps module

usb camera
 - can capture mjpeg video (.avi) which omxplayer can play
 - capture from webcam using cvlc
   ex: cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=mjpg:width=1280:height=720 --sout=file/avi:/tmp/out.avi
   ex: cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=mjpg:width=1280:height=720 --sout=file/avi:- # goes to stdout
   # 25fps 1280x720 60s ~> 280MB ; 1day = ~400GB
   # 30fps 1920x1080 68s ~> 350MB ; 1day = ~500GB


use `bin/cargs` to run gpg encryption on each 1MB chunk
and inject the newline (using echo)
than pipe to `mosquitto_pub` using `--stdin-line` flag so that
each 1MB video segment is sent as a seperate message
encrypted before it hits the disk
